# Flarum Language Generator

Scrap and translate Flarum language files automatically.

I think that this should be entirely recoded and made more efficient and glitch-free. I will do it, but this is at the bottom of my priorities list, so it won't
happen anytime soon.

THIS TOOL IS NOT MEANT TO COMPLETELY AUTOMATE THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A FLARUM LANGUAGE PACK! IT IS MEANT TO PROVIDE YOU A STARTING POINT
TO WORK ON FROM! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!


## Usage:

See scrap.py, translate.py and translate_with_mymemory.py.

## Note

This extension is under minimal maintenance.

It was developed for my needs. I have decided to release the source code public, if anyone else wants to look at it
