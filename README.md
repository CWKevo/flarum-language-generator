# Flarum Language Generator

Scrap and translate Flarum language files automatically.

## Known issues:
- translate_yaml() function is bloated and probably very inefficient
- If original contains apostrophe ('), the translated string gets cut to this point.

These are all issues with translate_yaml(), if I will get time for this project every again, I will fix them.


## Usage:

See scrap.py, translate.py and translate_with_mymemory.py.

## Note

This extension is under minimal maintenance.

It was developed for my needs. I have decided to release the source code public, if anyone else wants to look at it.
